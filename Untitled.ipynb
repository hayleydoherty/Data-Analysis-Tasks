    "The following code was obtained from Geeks for Geeks [1] with some alterations. It can be used to count the frequency of unique numbers strings in a list. The original code from Geeks for Geeks could only be used to count the frequency of distinct numbers in a list and did not return the output in the form of a dictionary. By not specifying that the output should be made up of integers (using %d as they did) my code is able to include strings in the input and the function successfully counts the frequency of both the numbers and strings.  \n",
